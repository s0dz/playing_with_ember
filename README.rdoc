== Playing With Rails

I started this project by emulating this fantastic implementation of a Todo rails 4.0/ember.js application found here: https://github.com/FeipingHunag/ember-todo

== To use

Simply execute the following:
  git clone https://github.com/s0dz/playing_with_ember.git
  cd playing_with_ember/
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seeds
  rails s

And then visit localhost:3000
